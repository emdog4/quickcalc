# quickcalc

Universal iOS 9 Swift storyboard application for common quick calculations and conversions. I designed this and developed it for personal use with plans to publish on the iTunes App Store. Pushes welcome, I would like to create a framework for the conversions. I've only spent a couple days on this project so far and don't have much time at the moment. After the annuities is finished I'd like to add calculations for  developers (hex, bin, decimal). Contact me if you'd like to contribute.
